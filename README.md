## Thanks for checking out my portfolio! 

### On this site, I give some background of myself, illustrate some of the projects I've worked on, and provide my contact information. This is the most current version of my portfolio, and it is available at https://t-ylerj.github.io/

#### The site is currently going through renovations - Check back later next week for some updated content/features :-)
