    <p class="name">Hi, my name is <span> Tyler Johnson.</span></p>
    <h2>I am a Business Intelligence Specialist.</h2>

    <p>I thrive on transforming complex problems into clear, data-driven solutions. With a passion for uncovering insights and improving business outcomes, I’ve found my niche in Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analysis. My background in consulting and audit gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and stakeholder communication—skills that now empower me to extract, analyze, and visualize data that drives meaningful decisions. I find joy in collaborating with others, knowing that diverse perspectives contribute to more innovative and effective outcomes.</p>
    <p>My technical toolkit includes SQL for querying and transforming data, Power BI for creating interactive dashboards, Python for automating workflows and data preparation, and JavaScript for application development. I bring a visual eye and design sensibility to every project, ensuring that the solutions I build are not only accurate, but intuitive and user-friendly. I’m energized by opportunities to collaborate cross-functionally, solve real business problems with data, and continuously refine how organizations interact with information.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="main">
      Hello! I am a former auditor-turned-consultant-turned-software engineer. My journey into the industry was fueled by my love for problem-solving and an eagerness for learning new things. What excites me most about tech is its constant evolution– there’s always a new skill or language to pick up. Sometimes the challenge lies in deciding where to focus your efforts. I’ve discovered a passion for taking an idea or vision and collaborating with other engineers to bring it to life through code. I find myself drawn to the creative side of software development, where I can merge my interest in graphic design and coding to create visually appealing and intuitive applications. For me, BI is more than reporting—it’s about empowering people with the right data at the right time. I enjoy collaborating across departments to understand goals, identify pain points, and deliver solutions that make a tangible impact. Whether it’s increasing operational efficiency or guiding strategic planning, I’m excited by any challenge where data is part of the answer.
    </p>
    <h3>Career Journey</h3>
    <img src="img/profile.jpeg"/>
    <p>
      Before my transition into data analysis, I studied accounting in college, earned my MBA,  and  started my career as an auditor for a large public accounting firm (KPMG). My first major project involved auditing the Department of Defense, where I traveled to different bases around the world to ensure that inventory records reported by the DoD actually matched what was held at the base– a challenging task that involved a lot of attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
      After that, I transitioned to my consulting role at Deloitte. I advised clients on how to navigate audits, helping them resolve issues and prepare for future evaluations. Although I eventually realized that accounting wasn’t my true passion, I discovered a love for problem-solving and helping clients turn abstract ideas into actionable solutions. This problem-solving drive led me to explore data analysis, where I could leverage my analytical skills and technical expertise in a more creative and impactful way.
      Wanting to build more technical solutions, I enrolled in a full-time coding bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in software development using JavaScript and SQL. It wasn’t until after the bootcamp, while applying to jobs, that I discovered Business Intelligence—and everything clicked. BI brought together my business background, technical training, and passion for data in a way that felt like a natural next step.
      
      Today, as a BI Specialist, I design and implement data-driven solutions that empower better decision-making. I write SQL to extract, clean, and transform large datasets, automate workflows with Python to boost efficiency, and build interactive dashboards in Power BI to surface meaningful insights. Whether it's optimizing a
      reporting process or building a new analytics tool from scratch, I aim to make data more accessible, accurate, and actionable.
      
      Data Analysis has become the sweet spot of my career—it allows me to blend strategic thinking with technical execution. I’m especially energized by opportunities to work cross-functionally, solve real business problems with data, and
      continuously refine how teams interact with and leverage information. I’m excited to keep growing in the data space, particularly in roles that combine analysis, automation, and collaboration to drive meaningful outcomes. The skills gained as an auditor and consultant– analytical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration–  have been invaluable in my transition to data analytics.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I’m excited to grow in roles that combine data analysis, data visualization, and storytelling. I want to help organizations unlock the full potential of their data—whether that’s by improving reporting processes, building self-service dashboards, or designing scalable analytics solutions. I aim to be a collaborative and thoughtful team member, always looking for ways to support colleagues and improve our shared work.
      Ultimately, I want to continue delivering insights that drive action, foster continuous improvement, and support smarter decision-making. Whether through better dashboards, cleaner data, or more efficient workflows, my goal is to create tools and solutions that make people’s work easier—and more impactful. Ultimately, I aim to leave a positive mark on the tech world, just as I have strived to leave every place I've worked in better than I found it.
    </p>
    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>
      One of the things I value most, both in my professional life and personal pursuits, is the challenge of continuous learning. This mindset led me to pursue a hobby I've been passionate about since childhood—gymnastics. I was fascinated by atheletes flipping and spinning around in the air, and I admired the strength and precision that the sport demands. It wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized I had the ability to make that dream a reality. I enrolled in an adult gymnastics class, and it quickly became one of my favorite hobbies. There's something incredibly satisfying about learning and mastering new skills, whether it's nailing a new move or perfecting a routine. The challenge of getting the mechanics right and sticking landings adds an element of fun that keeps me coming back for more.
