    <p class="name">Hi, my name is <span> Tyler Johnson.</span></p>
    <h2>I am a Full-Stack software engineer.</h2>

    <p>I thrive on transforming abstract concepts into well-designed, practical solutions. My passion for problem-solving led me to software development, where I get to combine my technical skills with my interest in graphic design to build intuitive and visually appealing applications. I find joy in collaborating with others, knowing that diverse perspectives contribute to more innovative and effective outcomes.</p>
    <p>With a background in consulting prior to transitioning to tech, I've honed a unique blend of analytical thinking, versatility, and problem-solving skills. My technical expertise includes proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Axios, jQuery, Tailwind, and REST APIs for client-side development. On the server-side, I’ve worked with Node.js, Express.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Git to build and maintain robust, scalable applications. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, constantly pushing myself to grow as a software engineer.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p class="main">
      Hello! I am a former auditor-turned-consultant-turned-software engineer. My journey into the industry was fueled by my love for problem-solving and an eagerness for learning new things. What excites me most about tech is its constant evolution– there’s always a new skill or language to pick up. Sometimes the challenge lies in deciding where to focus your efforts. I’ve discovered a passion for taking an idea or vision and collaborating with other engineers to bring it to life through code. I find myself drawn to the creative side of software development, where I can merge my interest in graphic design and coding to create visually appealing and intuitive applications. For me, ensuring a seamless user experience is just as important as the functionality of the product, as it plays a critical role in user adoption and satisfaction. As a full-stack engineer specializing in JavaScript, I’ve built several applications that reflect this approach. I strive to balance functionality with design to deliver the best possible product.
    </p>
    <h3>Career Journey</h3>
    <img src="img/profile.jpeg"/>
    <p>
      Before diving into software engineering, I studied accounting in college, earned my MBA,  and  started my career as an auditor for a large public accounting firm. My first major project involved auditing the Department of Defense, where I traveled to different bases around the world to ensure that inventory records reported by the DoD actually matched what was held at the base– a challenging task that involved a lot of attention to detail and problem-solving skills.
      After that, I transitioned to my consulting role at Deloitte. I advised clients on how to navigate audits, helping them resolve issues and prepare for future evaluations. Although I eventually realized that accounting wasn’t my true passion, I discovered a love for problem-solving and helping clients turn abstract ideas into actionable solutions. This problem-solving drive led me to software development, where I could leverage my analytical skills and technical expertise in a more creative and impactful way.
      The skills gained as an auditor and consultant– analytical thinking, adaptability, and collaboration–  have been invaluable in my transition to software engineering. My experience has equipped me with a unique perspective, enabling me to approach development with both precision and creativity. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute to producing polished, user-centric products that solve real-world problems.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I aspire to make a significant impact in the tech industry by contributing to a company's growth and success. I am excited about the opportunity to help create innovative solutions and see them come to life. In my next role, I want to continue being a supportive and collaborative teammate, guiding and assisting colleagues whenever they encounter challenges. My goal is to foster an environment of continuous learning and improvement, where we collectively strive to solve problems in the most effective ways possible. Ultimately, I aim to leave a positive mark on the tech world, just as I have strived to leave every place I've worked in better than I found it.
    </p>
    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>
      One of the things I value most, both in my professional life and personal pursuits, is the challenge of continuous learning. This mindset led me to pursue a hobby I've been passionate about since childhood—gymnastics. I was fascinated by atheletes flipping and spinning around in the air, and I admired the strength and precision that the sport demands. It wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized I had the ability to make that dream a reality. I enrolled in an adult gymnastics class, and it quickly became one of my favorite hobbies. There's something incredibly satisfying about learning and mastering new skills, whether it's nailing a new move or perfecting a routine. The challenge of getting the mechanics right and sticking landings adds an element of fun that keeps me coming back for more.
